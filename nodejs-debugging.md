## Debugging and Profiling

### Using Node.js Debugger
- **Introduction to Node.js Debugger**: The Node.js debugger is a powerful tool that helps you to debug your applications directly from the command line.
- **How to Use the Debugger**: Start the debugger by adding the `--inspect` flag when you run your Node.js application, which allows you to use Chrome DevTools for debugging.
- **Debugging Tips**: Use breakpoints to pause your code at specific points and examine variables to troubleshoot issues effectively.

### Profiling Node.js Applications
- **What is Profiling?**: Profiling is the process of monitoring the various resources an application uses and how it performs certain tasks to identify areas for improvement.
- **Tools for Profiling**: Use tools like `node --prof yourscript.js` to generate a profiling report that can be further analyzed to understand performance bottlenecks.
- **Analyzing the Profiling Report**: Learn to read and interpret the data provided in the profiling report to optimize your application.

### Memory Leak Identification
- **Understanding Memory Leaks**: A memory leak occurs when your application consumes more and more memory over time without releasing unused memory, which can lead to performance issues and crashes.
- **Tools to Identify Memory Leaks**: Use memory profiling tools such as the Chrome DevTools memory timeline or modules like `memwatch-next` and `node-memwatch` to monitor memory usage.
- **Preventing Memory Leaks**: Strategies to prevent memory leaks include proper management of global variables, closures, and event listeners, as well as regular monitoring and testing of the application's memory usage.
