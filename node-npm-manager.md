# Introduction to Node Package Manager (npm) for Managing Dependencies

Node Package Manager (npm) is a package manager for Node.js packages/modules. It helps developers manage project dependencies, install packages, and share code with other developers.

npm is automatically installed with Node.js, and it provides a command-line interface to interact with the npm registry, where thousands of packages are available for use in Node.js projects.

Key features of npm include:

- **Dependency Management**: npm allows developers to specify project dependencies in a `package.json` file and easily install/update them.

- **Package Installation**: Developers can install packages using the `npm install` command, which downloads and installs packages from the npm registry.

- **Versioning**: npm uses semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage package versions, ensuring compatibility and easy updates.

- **Scripts**: npm allows developers to define custom scripts in the `package.json` file, which can be executed using the `npm run` command.

- **Publishing Packages**: Developers can publish their own packages to the npm registry, making them available for others to use.

Overall, npm is a powerful tool that simplifies the management of dependencies in Node.js projects, making it easier for developers to build and maintain their applications.
